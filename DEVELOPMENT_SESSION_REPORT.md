# AthlosCore Development Session Report
*Session Date: September 24, 2025*

## Overview
This development session focused on implementing core video analysis and player analytics features for AthlosCore. The primary deliverables were a comprehensive VideoPlayer component with basketball-specific features and a Player Analytics Dashboard with AI-powered coaching insights.

## Major Features Implemented

### 1. VideoPlayer Component (`components/ui/VideoPlayer.tsx`)

#### Core Functionality
- **Video Playback Engine**: Built on expo-av with comprehensive playback controls
- **Custom Controls Interface**: Auto-hiding controls with 3-second timeout
- **Speed Control**: Variable playback speeds (0.5x, 0.75x, 1.0x, 1.25x, 1.5x, 2.0x)
- **Fullscreen Support**: Native fullscreen presentation with orientation handling
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both phone and tablet viewing

#### Basketball-Specific Features

##### Timeline Markers System
```typescript
interface TimelineMarker {
  id: string;
  timeMillis: number;
  type: 'score' | 'turnover' | 'foul' | 'timeout' | 'substitution' | 'quarter';
  title: string;
  description?: string;
}
```

**Visual Features**:
- Color-coded markers based on event type (green for scores, red for turnovers, etc.)
- Interactive timeline with click-to-jump functionality
- SF Symbols integration for basketball event icons
- Positioned over video scrub bar for precise navigation

**Event Types Supported**:
- **Scores**: Three-pointers, field goals, free throws
- **Turnovers**: Steals, loose balls, violations
- **Fouls**: Personal, shooting, technical fouls
- **Timeouts**: Team and official timeouts
- **Substitutions**: Player changes
- **Quarter Markers**: Period transitions

##### Player Tag Overlay System
```typescript
interface VideoTag {
  id: string;
  timeMillis: number;
  x: number; // percentage from left (0-100)
  y: number; // percentage from top (0-100)
  playerName?: string;
  playType: string;
  duration?: number; // display duration in milliseconds
}
```

**Visual Features**:
- Dynamic overlay bubbles appearing at specific video timestamps
- Positioned using percentage-based coordinates over video frame
- Player name and play type information
- Customizable display duration (default 3 seconds)
- Basketball-themed styling with primary color accents

#### Technical Implementation
- **State Management**: React hooks for playback status, controls visibility, fullscreen mode
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient re-rendering with useEffect cleanup
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on iOS, Android, and web platforms
- **Error Handling**: Loading states and fallback UI for video failures

### 2. Player Analytics Dashboard (`app/(tabs)/explore.tsx`)

#### Core Analytics Engine

##### Performance Rating System
```typescript
const getPerformanceRating = (stat: number, type: 'points' | 'rebounds' | 'assists' | 'fg%' | 'ft%'):
  'excellent' | 'good' | 'average' | 'needs-work'
```

**Basketball-Intelligent Thresholds**:
- **Points**: Excellent (20+), Good (15+), Average (10+), Needs Work (<10)
- **Rebounds**: Excellent (12+), Good (8+), Average (5+), Needs Work (<5)
- **Assists**: Excellent (8+), Good (5+), Average (3+), Needs Work (<3)
- **Field Goal %**: Excellent (50+%), Good (45+%), Average (40+%), Needs Work (<40%)
- **Free Throw %**: Excellent (80+%), Good (70+%), Average (60+%), Needs Work (<60%)

##### AI Coaching Recommendations
Dynamic recommendation engine based on performance patterns:

**Shooting Performance**:
- Low FG%: "Focus on shot selection and form fundamentals"
- High volume, low efficiency: "Work on quality over quantity in shooting"
- Strong FT%: "Excellent free throw shooting - great fundamentals"

**Playmaking Analysis**:
- High assists: "Great court vision and passing ability"
- Low assists: "Focus on reading the defense and finding open teammates"
- Balanced scoring/assists: "Well-rounded offensive game"

**Rebounding Assessment**:
- Strong rebounding: "Excellent positioning and effort on the boards"
- Weak rebounding: "Work on boxing out and anticipating ball trajectory"

#### User Interface Features
